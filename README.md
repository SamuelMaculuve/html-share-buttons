That will get your share buttons up and running! You’ll be sharing this website though, so there’s still more to be done…

Start by changing all instances of ‘https://simplesharebuttons.com’ with the URL of the site/page you wish the buttons to act for.

Note that you will need to include the http:// or https:// for the links to be shared correctly. All share buttons, bar Pinterest, will need this changing.

Next, change the four instances of ‘Simple Share Buttons’ to the title of the page or website that the buttons will be displayed. These are present for the following share buttons:

Twitter
Reddit
StumbleUpon
Email
There are further customisable options available for some of these share buttons, but let’s keep things simple for now.

Last, but by no means least, the images. The HTML code above will use buttons located on this website, which you are more than welcome to use. The buttons will load more quickly however if you upload them and change the image sources accordingly.

You can download a zipped folder of the ones in this example here.
